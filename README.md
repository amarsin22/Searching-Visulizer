### 🔎 Algorithms Implemented:

- 🔸 **Linear Search** – Searches each element one by one
- 🔸 **Binary Search** – Efficient search on sorted arrays

---

### 💻 Technologies Used:

- 🧱 **HTML5** – Page structure and elements  
- 🎨 **CSS3** – For styling and responsiveness  
- ⚙️ **JavaScript** – Logic behind searching and animations  
- 🎯 **DOM Manipulation** – For dynamic highlighting and visualization

---

### 🎯 Features:

- User can enter custom array elements  
- Choose between Linear or Binary Search  
- Highlighted steps show current comparison  
- Real-time animation of search process  
- Search result message (found/not found)  
- Clean, responsive user interface

---

### 🧪 How to Use:

1. Enter array elements in the input box  
2. Enter the number to be searched  
3. Choose a searching algorithm  
4. Click on **"Search"** and watch the animation
